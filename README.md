An __onsen__ is a term for hot springs in the Japanese language, though the term is often used to describe the bathing facilities and inns around the hot springs. Jigokudani Monkey Park is famous for its large population of __Snow Monkeys__, that go to the valley during the winter. Starting in 1963, the monkeys descend from the steep cliffs and forest to sit in the warm waters of the onsen, and return to the security of the forests in the evenings.
